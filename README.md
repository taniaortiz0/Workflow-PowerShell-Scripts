# Workflow PowerShell Scripts

I have provided some scripts that help my workflow management with ease whether I am at school or at work. These PowerShell Scripts detects contents within file explorer and also searches for duplicate copies. A prompt is provided to make a decision whether or not you want to delete your copies. I hope this helps!
